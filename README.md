# Starlink Zambia–Malawi Project
A documented case study of planning and executing a multi-site satellite internet rollout under real-world operational constraints.



## Overview
This repository documents a real-world satellite internet deployment project carried out across multiple sites in Zambia and Malawi.  
The project focused on restoring and stabilizing internet connectivity in environments where conventional solutions had consistently failed.

This is a practical case study covering constraints, decisions, execution realities, and lessons learned from operating in both urban and rural African contexts.

## The Problem
Reliable internet connectivity was largely unavailable across many target locations.

- In **rural areas**, there was effectively no usable internet.
- In **urban areas**, internet services existed but were unreliable and frequently unavailable.

Connectivity issues directly affected operations, reporting, coordination, and basic digital workflows.

---

## Why Conventional Solutions Failed
Traditional connectivity options were not viable for several reasons:

- **Power instability** was the primary issue.  
  - Rural locations often lacked reliable grid power.
  - Mobile operators had limited infrastructure investment due to power constraints.
- In cities, even “good” internet connections failed during **daily power blackouts**, as upstream infrastructure and local equipment went offline.
- Backup power solutions were either absent or insufficient to maintain continuous connectivity.

As a result, both fixed-line and mobile-based internet solutions proved unreliable.

---

## Constraints
The project was executed under multiple constraints, including:

- Extremely remote and rural site locations
- Limited or unreliable power infrastructure
- No established, on-site IT resources at many locations
- Lack of existing network equipment on the ground
- Incomplete or inaccurate site information prior to deployment
- Logistical challenges across long distances and multiple borders

These constraints required a highly adaptive, field-driven approach.

---

## Approach and Rationale
Satellite internet was selected as the most viable solution because it:

- Bypassed unreliable terrestrial infrastructure
- Reduced dependency on local telecom availability
- Could be deployed independently of existing networks
- Provided consistent performance once power was stabilized

The rollout prioritized:
- Rapid restoration of basic connectivity
- Use of locally available resources wherever possible
- Practical deployment over idealized designs

---

## What Worked
Several decisions proved effective:

- **Use of local resources and technicians**, including fabrication and installation support
- Flexible deployment approaches adapted to on-site realities
- Incremental problem-solving rather than rigid plans
- Satellite connectivity once power issues were mitigated

Local collaboration significantly reduced delays and improved sustainability.

---

## What Didn’t Work
Key challenges and missteps included:

- Entering sites with **incomplete or incorrect information**
- Underestimating how rural some locations truly were
- Assumptions that certain infrastructure or equipment already existed when it did not
- Reactive planning due to lack of early site validation

These issues increased setup time and required on-the-fly adjustments.

---

## What I’d Do Differently Next Time
If repeating the project, the following changes would be made:

- Conduct **physical or verified site surveys** before deployment
- Validate power availability and infrastructure upfront
- Avoid assumptions based on second-hand descriptions
- Plan deployments with a stronger “worst-case rural” baseline
- Allocate more preparation time before field execution

Better upfront visibility would have reduced friction significantly.
